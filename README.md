Build status: [![Continuous integration Actions Status](https://github.com/YuGiOhBot3000/yugiohbot-function-upload-card/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YuGiOhBot3000/yugiohbot-function-upload-card/actions)

This project sets up the card uploader for the YuGiOhBot.

## What it does
The function is called from an HTTP interface, and the parameters determine where the card image is found, it's title and any other information it needs.
It then uploads the card to Facebook with title and comment about the card posted.
